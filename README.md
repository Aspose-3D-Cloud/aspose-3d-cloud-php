# PHP Cloud REST API for 3D Processing

[Aspose.3D Cloud SDK for PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/3d/php) empowers your PHP applications to connect with 3D document formats. The APIs let engineers read, convert, build, alter and control the substance of the [3D document formats](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/3dcloud/Supported+Document+Formats) without any 3D modeling and rendering software installed on the machine..

## 3D Processing Features

- Create 3D entities (Box, Sphere, Plane, Torus, Cylinder).
- Perform processing of 3D models and attributes.
- Perform transformation, translation, rotation & scaling of 3D objects.
- Conversion of 3D files to another format.
- Convert whole of the 3D file or convert a specific part only.
- Extract 3D scenes and export to various formats.
- Perform parametric modeling, 3D modeling & data processing.
- Create cloud-based folder structure & perform cloud-based conversion of 3D files.
- Extract raw data or 3D content from a password-protected 3D PDF file.
- Supports working with triangulate meshes, triangulate whole or part of the 3D scene.
- Address nodes by object addressing path or remove nodes with attached light or camera.
- Remove 3D objects from a scene.
